# LocalLLMtextClassification
This project implements a text classification system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) running locally. The goal is to leverage the capabilities of modern LLMs to automatically categorize and label text data without relying on external APIs or manual human labeling, ensuring privacy, autonomy, and efficiency in text processing tasks.
